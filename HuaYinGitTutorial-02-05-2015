GibHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It was created by Tom preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath and PJ Hyett in April 2008.There are other platforms for version controlling, such as Apache Subversion, CVS and so on. I have used CVS before when I worked in a development team. but I have not touch with GitHub. It's the first time I use GitHub. And I found that GitHub was frequently used by software engineer. So I need try my best to learn it and introduce to my students.
